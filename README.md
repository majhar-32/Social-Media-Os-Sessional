# 🖥️ Terminal Social Media App
### *A fully functional social media platform — built entirely in Bash*

> **OS Sessional Project** | No database, no server, no framework — just Shell Script + plain text files.

---

## 📌 What Is This?

This is a **terminal-based social media application** written purely in **Bash shell scripting**. It runs directly in your terminal and supports:

- 👤 User Registration & Login
- 📝 Create & View Posts (your own feed)
- ❤️ Like & 💬 Comment on Posts
- 👥 Follow other users
- 💬 **Live Real-Time Chat** between two terminals
- 📋 Conversation List
- 👤 Profile view (posts, followers, following count)

All data is stored in **plain `.txt` files** using `|` as a delimiter — no external dependencies required.

## 📊 Data Relationship Diagram

This shows how all the data files are connected to each other:

```
┌─────────────┐
│  users.txt  │◄──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ id|name|pass│                                       │

│  likes.txt  │   │ comments.txt │
│ post|user   │   │post|user|name│
└─────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

**Key rules maintained in the data:**
- `likes.txt` → `post_id` must exist in `posts.txt`, `user_id` must exist in `users.txt`
- `comments.txt` → same as above
- `follows.txt` → both IDs must exist in `users.txt`, no self-follows
- `messages.txt` → both `sender_id` and `receiver_id` must exist in `users.txt`

#### 💬 Live Chat — How It Works

**Step 1 — Open two terminals** and login with different accounts:

```bash
# Terminal 1
bash main.sh   →  login as alice

# Terminal 2
bash main.sh   →  login as bob
```

**Step 2 — Both go to:** Messages → `1` → Live Chat

**Terminal 1 (alice):**
```
Enter username to chat with: bob

=== Chat with bob ===
alice: Hey bob! How are you doing?
bob: Hi alice! I am great, thanks for asking.
...
[Live] bob is online — messages appear in real time
(Type /exit to leave chat)
```

**Terminal 2 (bob):**
```
[Live] alice is online — messages appear in real time
(Type /exit to leave chat)
```

**Step 3 — Start typing!** Messages appear on the other screen instantly 🎉

---

#### 🔄 What If One User Is Not Online Yet?

```
[Offline] bob is not online — messages will be saved as history
          Waiting for bob to come online...
```

- You can still **send messages** — they are saved as history
- The app **automatically checks every 1 second** if they come online
- When bob opens live chat → your terminal instantly shows:

```
>>> [Live] bob just came online! You are now in real-time chat.
```

✅ No need to restart chat — it switches to live mode automatically.

---

#### 📋 Conversation List

```
Choose option: 2

=== Your Conversations ===
bob
charlie
```

Shows all users you have chatted with. Your own name is never shown.

---

#### ⏹️ Exiting Live Chat

```
/exit
```

> Both `/exit` and `Ctrl+C` clean up properly — no zombie processes left.

## 🔄 How to Reset Data (Fresh Start)

To wipe all data and start clean:

```bash
# Clear all data files
echo -n "" > data/users.txt
echo -n "" > data/posts.txt
echo -n "" > data/follows.txt
echo -n "" > data/likes.txt
echo -n "" > data/comments.txt
echo -n "" > data/messages.txt
echo -n "" > data/active_chats.txt
echo -n "" > data/watcher_pids.txt

# Reset all ID counters to 0
echo "0" > counters/user_id.txt
echo "0" > counters/post_id.txt
echo "0" > counters/comment_id.txt
echo "0" > counters/message_id.txt
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes (OS Concepts Used)

| Concept | Where Used |
|---|---|
| **File I/O** | All data storage (users, posts, messages, etc.) |
| **Process Management** | `$$`, `$!`, background jobs (`&`) |
| **Named Pipes (FIFOs)** | Live chat message streaming between terminals |
| **Signal Handling** | `trap` on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for clean exit |
| **IPC** | `active_chats.txt` coordinates which users are live |
| **Background Processes** | Online monitor polls `active_chats.txt` every 1s |

### Live Chat Internal Flow

```
User A types message
        │
        ▼
Writes to messages.txt
        │
        ▼
tail -f (User B's session) detects new line
        │
        ▼
Writes to named FIFO (.chat_fifo_PID)
        │
        ▼
while-reader filters: is this for me?
        │
        ▼
Prints to User B's terminal instantly
```

### Session Tracking Files *(auto-managed, not committed to git)*

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/active_chats.txt` | Who is in live chat right now (with live shell PID) |
| `data/watcher_pids.txt` | Exact tail & reader PIDs for clean process kill |
| `data/.chat_fifo_<PID>` | Named pipe for each live chat session |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Permission denied` when running | Script not executable | Run `chmod +x *.sh` |
| `syntax error` or weird behavior | Running with `zsh` or `sh` | Always use `bash main.sh` |
| Messages appearing in wrong terminal | Orphaned `tail` process from old crashed session | Run `pkill -f "tail -n 0 -f"` in terminal |
| Live chat stuck on `[Offline]` | Stale entry in `active_chats.txt` | App cleans it automatically on next chat open; or manually clear the file |
| `User not found` when chatting | Typo in username | Check exact username with Conversation List |
| New message ID conflicts | Counter file out of sync | Set counter to match the last line count in that data file |

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| 🔐 Plain text passwords | Passwords are stored as-is — this is a learning project, not production |
| 🖥️ Same machine only | Live chat works between terminals on the **same computer** (shared filesystem) |
| 🔒 No write locks | Concurrent writes to data files are not locked — unlikely to cause issues in small scale |
| 🔔 No notifications | Notification feature intentionally removed to keep the app clean |
| 📷 No media support | Text only — no image, video, or file sharing |
| 💤 No offline message alert | If you're not in live chat, you won't know someone messaged you until you open Messages |

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Ideas for Teammates)

If you want to extend this project, here are some ideas:
- 🔐 **Password Hashing:** Use `openssl` or `sha256sum` to store passwords securely.
- 🖼️ **ASCII Art Support:** Allow users to "upload" ASCII art as posts.
- 🔍 **Search Feature:** Add a way to search for users or posts by keywords.
- 📅 **Post Timestamps:** Convert Unix timestamps to human-readable dates in the feed.
- 🚫 **Block User:** Implement a blocking system to prevent unwanted messages.
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard:** A special mode to view system-wide stats (total users, most liked post, etc.).
